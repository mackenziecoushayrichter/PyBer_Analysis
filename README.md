# PyBer Rideshare Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
* The purpose of this analysis was to analyze data from the rideshare company PyBer.
* With this data I created a Summary DataFrame of the data by City Type (Rural, Suburban, Urban).  The Summary DataFrame showed:
  * The Total Rides by City Type
  * Total Number of Drivers by City Type
  * Sum of Total Fares by City Types
  * Average Fare per Ride by City Type
  * Average Fare per Driver by City Type
* The second part of this analysis was that I used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
## Results
* Each city type had varying results when it came to the different data points that I analyzed.
* Below is the summary DataFrame that I created from that data:
